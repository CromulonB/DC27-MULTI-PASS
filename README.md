# DC27-MULTI-PASS
The MULTI PASS badge is running the firmware created by [badge.team](https://github.com/badgeteam/ESP32-Firmware). It is a unified badge platform that supports running apps written in python. Along with there is a repository of apps written by other users called the [hatchery](https://badge.team/). The MULTI PASS is compatible with apps written for the SHA and HackerHotel badges.

## Software Issues

We did have some capacitive touch issues with the boards from the fab. With fab delays and limited time tos ship before DefCon we were forced to ship with a firmware that was only partially working. We have released a new firmware above and we appologize for the inconvenience.
